# Objective

This web page was started using a desktop first layout. Use media queries to produce responsive design layout that works as the browser is scaled down.

## Image 1

Image 1 appears as is when the web page is fully stretched out to take up the most amount of horizontal space. While this works pay attention to a few things:

1. The usage of CSS Grid to make the menu layout.
2. The mix of grid and flexbox containers. Flexbox is used for flow within the grid.
3. The latte images resize as the browser size changes.

## Image 2

As we resize the browser down the space starts to become cramped. Make the following layout changes (approx. 1400px):

1. Menu switches to stacking the items vertically (no grid).
2. Special Lattes rotates to match other headings.
3. Items under avocado toasts should stack (image on top, description below).

## Image 3

Make the following layout changes (approx. 1024px):

1. Special Lattes should have 3 columns for lattes across.


## Image 4

Make the following layout changes (approx. 878px):

1. The padding in the body should be reduced.
1. The address should move to its own line beneath the title.
1. The legend will stack vertically.
1. The font-size in the address can be reduced to fit better.

## Image 5

Make the final layout changes (approx. 500px):

1. The menu items will be 1 per row.
1. The lattes will be 1 per row.
