# Test Driven Development (TDD)

### Roman Numerals Kata (Challenge)

#### Step 1

The Romans were a clever bunch. They conquered most of Europe and ruled it for hundreds of years.  One thing they never discovered  was the number zero. This made writing and dating extensive histories of their exploits slightly more challenging, but the system of numbers they came up with is still in use today. For example the BBC uses Roman numerals to date their programs.

The Romans wrote numbers using letters - I, V, X, L, C, D, M. (notice these letters have lots of straight lines and are hence easy to hack into stone tablets).

The kata says you should write a method to convert from normal numbers to Roman Numerals: eg `string ConvertToRomanNumeral(int n)`.

For example:

| Number | Roman Numeral |
| ------ | ------------- |
| 1      | I             |
| 10     | X             |
| 7      | VII           |

There is no need to be able to convert numbers larger than about 3000. (The Romans themselves didn't tend to go any higher.)

Note that you can't write numerals like "IM" for 999. Wikipedia says: Modern Roman numerals ... are written by expressing each digit separately starting with the left most digit and skipping any digit with a value of zero. To see this in practice, consider the ... example of 1990. In Roman numerals 1990 is rendered: 1000=M, 900=CM, 90=XC; resulting in MCMXC. 2008 is written as 2000=MM, 8=VIII; or MMVIII.
