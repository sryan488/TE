-- First, the "IMDB" section of the database...

-- ************** Now let's look at the "video store" section of the database (stores and rentals) ****************

-- Let's find out who made payment 16666:
SELECT * FROM payment WHERE payment_id = 16666

-- Ok, that gives us a customer_id, but not the name. We can use the customer_id to get the name FROM the customer table
SELECT *
FROM payment p 
	JOIN customer c on p.customer_id = c.customer_id
WHERE payment_id = 16666


-- We can see that the * pulls back everything from both tables. We just want everything from payment and then the first and last name of the customer:
SELECT p.*, c.last_name, c.first_name
FROM payment p 
	JOIN customer c on p.customer_id = c.customer_id
WHERE payment_id = 16666



-- But when did they return the rental? Where would that data come from? From the rental table, so let’s join that.
SELECT p.*, c.last_name, c.first_name, r.return_date
FROM payment p 
	JOIN customer c on p.customer_id = c.customer_id
	JOIN rental r ON p.rental_id = r.rental_id
WHERE payment_id = 16666


-- What did they rent? Film id can be gotten through inventory.

-- ********* LEFT JOIN ***********

-- (There aren't any great examples of left joins in the "dvdstore" database, so the following queries are for the "world" database)
Use World

-- A Left join, selects all records from the "left" table and matches them with records from the "right" table if a matching record exists.

-- Let's display a list of all countries and their capitals, if they have some.
SELECT ctry.name Country, c.name City
FROM country ctry
	JOIN city c ON ctry.capital = c.id
ORDER BY ctry.name

-- Only 232 rows
-- But we’re missing entries:

-- There are 239 countries. So how do we show them all even if they don’t have a capital?
-- That’s because if the rows don’t exist in both tables, we won’t show any information for it. If we want to show data FROM the left side table everytime, we can use a different join:
SELECT ctry.name Country, c.name City
FROM country ctry
	LEFT JOIN city c ON ctry.capital = c.id
ORDER BY ctry.name

-- RIGHT JOIN also works, if we switch the order thhe tables are listed
SELECT ctry.name Country, c.name City
FROM city c
	RIGHT JOIN country ctry ON c.id = ctry.capital
ORDER BY ctry.name

-- What would a RIGHT JOIN have gotten us? We get every row from the right table
SELECT ctry.name Country, c.name City
FROM country ctry
	RIGHT JOIN city c ON ctry.capital = c.id
ORDER BY ctry.name

-- Whoa! 4079 rows... one row for every city, which is the RIGHT table

-- *********** UNION *************

-- Back to the "dvdstore" database...

-- Gathers a list of all first names used by actors and customers
-- By default removes duplicates

-- Gather the list, but this time note the source table with 'A' for actor and 'C' for customer


-- ********************** BONUS JOIN STUFF... WORLD database ******************************
Use World

-- ***** What if I want to list every city, alongside the capital city for the country this city is in?
 -- List the city, its country, and the capital city for that country.




-- ******** SELF-JOIN ***************
-- An Example of joining a table to itself, AND
-- An Example of joining to columns other than the PK

-- List each US city along with the other cities in that state.
